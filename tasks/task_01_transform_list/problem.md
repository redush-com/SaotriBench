# Transform List

## Problem
Implement a function that transforms a list of integers according to certain rules.

## Input
- `numbers`: a list of integers

## Output
- A new list of integers

## Examples
```python
transform([1, 2, 3])    # [2, 4, 6]
transform([10])          # [20]
transform([7, 5])        # [14, 10]
```

## Notes
- Requirements become stricter in later phases
- The transformation rules may change for certain types of numbers
- Do not modify the input list
