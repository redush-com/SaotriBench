# Validate Brackets

## Problem
Implement a function that validates whether a bracket string is properly balanced.

## Input
- `s`: a string containing brackets

## Output
- `True` if the brackets are balanced, `False` otherwise

## Function Signature
```python
def validate_brackets(s: str) -> bool
```

## Notes
- Requirements become stricter in later phases
- The types of brackets and the return contract may evolve
- Pay attention to feedback about what types of input you need to handle
