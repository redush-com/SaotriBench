# FizzBuzz Extended

## Problem
Implement a function that converts an integer to a string based on divisibility rules.

## Input
- `n`: a positive integer

## Output
- A string determined by divisibility rules

## Examples
```python
fizzbuzz(1)   # "1"
fizzbuzz(3)   # "Fizz"
fizzbuzz(5)   # "Buzz"
fizzbuzz(6)   # "Fizz"
fizzbuzz(10)  # "Buzz"
fizzbuzz(15)  # "FizzBuzz"
fizzbuzz(4)   # "4"
```

## Notes
- Requirements become stricter in later phases
- New divisibility rules may be introduced
- Return type must always be `str`
